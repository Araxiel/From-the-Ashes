Where each state goes is a complete vibes based thing and where it makes the most sense compared to the other states. I.e. Iberian states could go both in West or South Europe, but it makes more sense to put it in South Europe in this mod, because it allows grouping a bunch of states (and their associated countries) into Southern Europe which denominates they survived better than the rest of Europe.

While they should also be grouped together by strategic region, in this first iteration that's not a priority.
