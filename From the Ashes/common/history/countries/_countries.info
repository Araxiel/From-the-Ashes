In vanilla Vic3, every country has its very own file, that includes the tag and the spelled out name.
While that might make sense for Vic3 devs' workflows, it seems like quite a hassle. 
As such here most countries are bundled together.

The first number relates to the following entries:

00_west_europe
01_south_europe
02_east_europe
03_north_africa
04_subsaharan_africa
05_north_america
06_central_america
07_south_america
08_middle_east
09_central_asia
10_india
11_east_asia
12_indonesia
13_australasia
14_siberia

Which specific file they go in tho, depends more on their capital together with vibes. I.e. Great Britain is in `10` for India, because that's where it's centered on at the start, meanwhile France fits more in `01` for South Europe, even tho in Vanilla it's in Western Europe and the capital is in north Africa.
