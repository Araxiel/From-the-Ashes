Countries are grouped by general vibes, and in relation to their history files.

There should be an attempt to have it be consistent across all files (history/countries, history/states, country_definitions etc.).

00_west_europe
01_south_europe
02_east_europe
03_north_africa
04_subsaharan_africa
05_north_america
06_central_america
07_south_america
08_middle_east
09_central_asia
10_india
11_east_asia
12_indonesia
13_australasia
14_siberia

if there's a 'v' behind the number, this means that file only contains vanilla nations which have little to no role change, and are primarily just filler or releasable.
